##  Readme for grabbing Radio schedules off the site

Hi, here are the JavaScript source files which i minimized to bookmarklets to make the job of scraping stuff off sites easier.

###  How do i use them?

You dont need to minimise it. Just head over to the site and open the developer console. Then paste the code from the relavant site in the console. Enjoy!

###  The sites?

[downtown](http://www.downtown.co.uk/on-air/station-schedule/)
[Setanta](http://www.setanta.com/ie/listings/index.html)
[talkSPORT](http://talksport.com/radio/schedule)
[citybeat](http://citybeat.co.uk/schedule/)

### How Do i make my own grabber?

This bit is coming up soon.
